# PacMen Exercise

### Description

This program allows users to add PacMen to a webpage. The user can then start an animation in which each PacMan, with varying position and velocity, will move around the webpage, bouncing off the walls of the webpage.

### How to Run

1. Download the zip file in github and load **index.html** in a browser.
2. Click **"Add PacMan"** to add additional PacMen to the screen, then click **"Start Game"** to begin the animation.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements

- **Changing Images:** I plan to improve the code so that each PacMan opens and closes his mouth as he moves across the screen. When each PacMan changes directions on the side walls, I will make it so the image of PacMan also turns around.
- **Styling:** I plan to improve the styling of the buttons on the page, along with creating a background that matches the look and feel of the game PacMan.
